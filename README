# Out-of-Distribution Detection for Food-101 Classification
 Advanced OOD detection system combining Energy, Mahalanobis, Gradient, and CORES methods for reliable food classification

## Project Overview
**Objective**: Detect out-of-distribution inputs in a Food-101 classifier using multi-method fusion.

*Key Features**:
- ✅ 4 OOD detection methods with score fusion
- ✅ 84.1% test accuracy on Food-101
- ✅ 96% AUROC on SVHN as OOD
- ✅ Progressive training strategy

# Datasets
- To install the **Food 101** dataset we downloaded and unzipped the folder present at the link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101) offered in the project presentation
- To install the OOD datasets: **SVHN**, **DTD**, **CIFAR10** and **Places365** we used the APIs in the torchvision.datasets module to get them but they can be found at:
  - https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html (CIFAR10)
  - https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/ (DTD)
  - http://places2.csail.mit.edu/index.html (Places365)
  - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stanfordu/street-view-house-numbers (SVHN)
